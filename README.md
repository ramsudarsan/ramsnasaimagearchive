## Ram's NASA Image Archive
**This is my submission for the Capital One SWE Summit Mindsumo Challenge for Summer 2019.**

**[Link to App](https://ramsudarsan.github.io/ramsnasaimagearchive)**

## Libraries/Tools used:
[React](https://reactjs.org/) for component based rendering and state management

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to handle routing and queries in URL

[NASA Image and Video Library](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images) (use required by MindSumo challenge)

[gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) for deployment of the application to Github pages

## What I learned:
I got a lot of valuable experience using React. I used React Router for the first time and was able to see the benefits of routing on the front-end. I experimented a lot with CSS styling and animations and discovered how to do some pretty neat things through trial and error, like the hover animation on the result cards, and the popup labels for the text boxes.

## What I would have liked to add:
Definitely would have tried to add sign in and saving functionality if I had more time to play with PostgreSQL and express.js.
